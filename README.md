I'm sort of keeping a reboot here of my old graphics tools.  Feel free to fork or request pull or open issue.

Some guidelines:
* code is primarily in C++
* uses GLFW for windowing
* uses OpenMP for threading (if possible)

Subtrees:
* library - headers and implementations
* simple_spin - hardcoded vertex array polytope with trackball
